Stanford University and the Department of Behavioral Sciences is seeking a Software Engineer to help develop and maintaining scalable, production-grade frontend and backend systems to help support autism research in AI. The Software Engineer will work with the PI and other staff members to execute all programming tasks, including programming, analyzing, designing, developing, implementing, modifying, and maintaining computer programs. 

The School of Medicine’s Department of Psychiatry and The School of Engineering Computer Sciences group at Stanford have collaborated over the last seven years to develop modules for verbal individuals on the autism spectrum. They are currently refining, researching, and developing additional modules to show that the AI modules are effective and generalize to human conversation. One Randomized Clinical Trial has been published and smaller studies are currently being implemented with the goal of providing accessible and effective treatment to autistic adolescents and adults. 

Duties include:

·       Conceptualize design, implement, and develop solutions for complex system/programs independently. 

·       Work with a variety of users to gain information, and develop intra-system tradeoffs between different users, as necessary; interact with a diverse client base and outside vendor contacts.

·       Document system builds and application configurations; maintain and update documentation as needed.

·       Provide technical analysis, design, development, conversion, and implementation work. 

·       Work as a project leader, as needed, for projects of moderate complexity. 

·       Serve as a technical resource for applications.

·       Compare, evaluate, and implement new features and technologies, and integrate them into the computing environment.

·       Follow team software development methodology. 

·       Mentor lower level software developers.
